The toolbar is a means of presenting the user with global app controls, 
along with the display of some useful information.
Starting from the left and going to the right in the above image, the toolbar:

1. provides a button to show/hide the control panel for the application 
2. displays the information of the current version of the QuickView app 
3. contains a helpful widget to control the camera for the variables being currently explored -- by zooming in/out, and moving camera up/down or left/right.
4. contains the button used to load views with the current variable selection, this process does not happen interactively as the user selects/deselects variables to analyze.
5. contains some useful options for selecting color presets. 
6. displays data and connectivity file names and locations that are currently being used for analysis
7. provides a button to save the application configuration/state to the disk, which can be later imported.
8. provides a button to reset all the views at once.
