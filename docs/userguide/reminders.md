# Key reminders for using EAM QuickView


- EAM QuickView can be [launched](launch.md) in two ways: from simulation data (for starting a new visualization) or from a state file (for resuming an analysis).

- Regardless of which way of launch is used, a [connectivity file](connectivity.md) is needed together with the simulation data file.

- Most buttons, sliders, and selection boxes in the UI apply their effects immediately upon user interaction. The only exception is the variable selection: after variables are chosen for the first time following app launch, or after the selection is changed, the user must click the `LOAD VARIABLES` button in the [toolbar](toolbar.md) for the new selection to take effect.
