**Toolbar**:
The [toolbar](toolbar.md) located at the top of the GUI
   contains buttons and text boxes for loading data files and
   controling various global properties of the application.

**Control Panel**:
The [control panel](control_panel.md) located on the left
   of the GUI allows the user to select data slices to represent,
   i.e., variables, time slices, vertical levels, horizontal domains
   and map projections. The control panel can be collapsed or
   shown using the hamburger icon (three stacked lines)
   at the left end of the [toolbar](toolbar.md).

**Viewport**
 The [viewport](view_port.md) displays one or more variables for
   the user. For each variable, the colormap, value ranges etc.
   can be adjusted individually using the associated gear icon.
