# Graphical User Interface (GUI)

EAM QuickView's GUI contains the four main components summarized below.
Detailed descriptions can be found on the linked pages.

1. The [toolbar](toolbar.md) located at the top of the GUI
   contains buttons and text boxes for loading data files and
   controling various global properties of the application.

2. The collapsible [control panel](control_panel.md) located on the left
   of the GUI allows the user to select data slices to represent,
   i.e., variables, time slices, vertical levels, horizontal domains
   and map projections. The control panel can be collapsed or
   made visible using the hamburger icon (three horizontal lines stacked
   on top of each other )
   on the left end of the [toolbar](toolbar.md).

3. The [viewport](view_port.md) displays one or more variables for
   the user. For each variable, the colormap, contour level etc.
   can be adjusted individually using the associated gear icon.

4. The [camera action widget](camera.md) located in the bottom right
   corner of the viewport are used for centrally adjusting all views
   in the viewport, i.e., zooming in or out, or moving the displayed
   images with respect to the GUI.
