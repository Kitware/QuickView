# Planned Improvements

For the upcoming releases, we plan to prioritize the following:

- adding support for server-client model and deploying servers to
  Department of Energy's Leadership Computing Facilities;
- addressing the display issues that currently need a camera reset
  as a remedy (see the [Reminders page](reminders.md);
- providing the functionality of allowing the user to specify
  a center longitude for the contour plots.

Addional suggestions are welcome. Bug reports and feature requests
can be made by opening new
[issues](https://github.com/ayenpure/QuickView/issues) on GitHub.
