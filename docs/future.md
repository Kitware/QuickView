# Planned Improvements

For the upcoming releases, we plan to prioritize the following:

- adding support for the server-client model and deploying servers to
  Department of Energy's Leadership Computing Facilities;
- leveraging [ParaView's](https://www.paraview.org/) parallel processing
  capabilities to process many variables or high-resolution data;
- adding support for the cubed-sphere meshes used by EAM's dynamical
  core, i.e., the np4 grids; 
- addressing the display issues that currently need a camera reset
  as a remedy (see the [Reminders page](userguide/reminders.md);
- allowing the user to specify a center longitude for the contour plots.

Addional suggestions are welcome. Bug reports and feature requests
can be made by opening new
[issues](https://github.com/ayenpure/QuickView/issues) on GitHub.
