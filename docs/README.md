## What is QuickView?

**EAM QuickView** is an open-source, interactive visualization tool
designed for scientists working with the atmospheric component of the
[Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM)](https://e3sm.org/),
known as the E3SM Atmosphere Model (EAM).
Its Python- and [Trame](https://www.kitware.com/trame/)-based
Graphical User Interface (GUI) provides
intuitive access to [ParaView](https://www.paraview.org/)'s
powerful analysis and visualization capabilities, without the steep learning curve.

---
## Quick Start

- Install and launch the app for [end users](setup/for_end_users.md)
  or for [app developers](setup/for_app_developers.md).
- Download [connectivity files](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16908566)
  of EAM's cubed-sphere grids from Zenodo.
- Optional: download [sample simulation output](https://zenodo.org/records/16922607)
  to test the app.
- For EAMv2 and v3 developers and users: if your simulation data files
  are *not* the original files written out by the model,
  i.e., if your files were generated by NCO, CDO, etc.
  check QuickView's [data format requirements](userguide/data_requirements.md).
- For EAMxx developers and users: EAMxx's most recent output format
  changes might not have been accommodated. If your run into problems
  opening your data files, please check the
  [Issues tab on GitHub](https://github.com/ayenpure/QuickView/issues) and
  open a new issue if needed.

For more details, go to the navigation bar of this website and look for
our User's Guide.

## Why QuickView?

While comprehensive visualization tools like
[ParaView](https://www.paraview.org/) and
[VisIt](https://visit-dav.github.io/visit-website/index.html) are widely used in
the scientific community, they often present a steep learning curve—requiring
users who are not experts in visual analytics
to navigate unfamiliar interfaces, functions, and jargon. Moreover, these
general-purpose tools may lack out-of-the-box support for key requirements in
atmospheric sciences, such as globe and map projections or support for specific
data formats and structures, leading to time-consuming customization or feature
requests. EAM QuickView was developed to address these limitations by offering a
focused, user-friendly platform that streamlines the analysis of atmospheric
simulations. It minimizes the need for EAM developers and users to write custom
scripts, thereby shortening the path from data to insight.

The core goal of EAM QuickView is a first glance at the contents in a simulation
data file, i.e., a first inspection of the characteristic values of
physical quantities and their variations
with respect to geographical location, altitude, and time,
as well as a quick inspection across different physical quantities
for similarities or distinctions.
Compared to earlier and widely used tools like
[ncview](https://cirrus.ucsd.edu/ncview/) and
[ncvis](https://github.com/SEATStandards/ncvis), QuickView has an emphasis on
multivariate visualization and is currently focused on the EAM model.

## Key Features

- Intuitive, minimalist interface tailored for atmospheric modeling.
- Multi-variable visualization with drag-and-drop layout.
- Persistent sessions - pick up where you left off.
- Support for EAM v2, v3, and upcoming v4 output formats.
