## Views

Once the user has selected the necessary variables for their analysis and used the `Load Variables` button, the QuickView app will create a view for every variable. Each view would look like the once below. 

![view-collapsed](../images/view-collapsed.png){ width="400" }

The view, apart from showing the ParaView rendering of the variable, also has two key components. 

1. View Settings -- a button on the bottom left with a gear cog icon, which presents additional options related to the view. 
2. Expand View -- a drag-resize button on the bottom right, which lets users control the size of the specific view. 

The below image shows the expanded view settings panel. 

![view-expanded](../images/view-expanded.png){ width="400" }

The panel contains option to control the properties of the view 
- the color map used to color the variable
- options for mapping color -- log scale, inverted color map, or show/hide color bar
- options to control the min and max values for color mapping
- a button to reset the color mapping to the range of values in the data
