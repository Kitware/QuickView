# Installation and Launch for End Users


At version 1.0, QuickView is expected to be installed and used from a personal computer with the data files also being local. Future versions will support the server-client model allowing access to remote data files.

Releases so far have focused on MacOS. Installers for Linux and Windows systems can be provided upon request.

# Installation

For end users, we provide pre-built binaries that can be installed using just a few clicks.

1. Download the latest installer from the [releases page](https://github.com/ayenpure/QuickView/releases/tag/v0.1.13). Mac users with Apple Silicon chips should download `QuickView_{version}_aarch64.dmg`, and those with Intel chips should download a `*_x64.dmg` file.
2. Double-click the downloaded `.dmg` file. In the pop-up window, drag the QuickView icon into the Applications folder.


The pre-built binaries include all dependencies needed to start the app on a local computer.
Additional dependencies needed for data processing and visualization are downloaded and installed automatically when the app is launched for the first time.
