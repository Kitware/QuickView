**EAM QuickView** is an interactive visualization tool
tailored for scientists working with the atmospheric component of the
[Energy Exascale Earth System Model](https://e3sm.org/) (EAM, 
[Rasch et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1029/2019MS001629);
[Golaz et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1029/2022MS003156);
[Donahue et al., 2024](10.1029/2024MS004314)).
The Graphical User Interface (GUI) built with Python and
powered by [Trame](https://www.kitware.com/trame/)
gives users intuitive access to the powerful visualization capabilities of
[ParaView](https://www.paraview.org/)  
without requiring a steep learning curve.

## Key Features

- Intuitive, minimalist interface tailored for atmospheric modeling.
- Multi-variable visualization with drag-and-drop layout.
- Persistent sessions - pick up where you left off.
- Support for EAM v2, v3, and upcoming v4 output formats.

## Quick Start

- Install and launch for [end users](docs/setup/for_end_users.md)
  and [app developers](docs/setup/for_app_developers.md).
- Download connectivity files of EAM's cubed sphere grids from a
  [Zenodo record](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16908567).
- Optional: download [sample simulation output]()
  to test the app.
- For EAMv2 and v3 developers and users: if your simulation data files
  are *not* the original files written out by the model,
  i.e., if your files were generated by NCO, CDO, etc.
  check QuickView's [data format requirements]().
- For EAMxx developers and users: EAMxx's most recent output format
  updates might not have been accommodated. If your run into issues
  opening your data files, please contact our
  [lead developer](https://www.kitware.com/abhishek-yenpure/).
